      - LoginHome.tsx

Notes
- `src/screens/tablet` holds React Native tablet screens (placeholders for now).
- Existing web-style mockups in `src/` (using div/className) are kept for reference; they are not wired into the RN app. We can move them under `src/prototypes/web/` if you want to keep them here, or shift them into the web app.
- Removed duplicate numbered files with spaces in names.
